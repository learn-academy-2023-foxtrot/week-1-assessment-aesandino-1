# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions --
Answer the following questions.
First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. If you don't know the answer a good tip is to answer a simpler version of the question.
Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

2. Which JavaScript operators will return a Boolean value?

4. Compare and contrast arrays and strings. Please include ways in which they are the same and ways in which they are different.
Your answer: Arrays are associated with index's, while strings are essentially statements within quotations. They are similar in the way that they organize variables and condions within code. They are different by how they are communicated.
Researched answer: Arrays are data types that are collections of data. Strings store and manipulate code. They both gather pieces of coding data.
5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?
Your answer: One person is the driver, while the other is the navigator - the role of the driver is to type the code and the role of the navigator is to tell the driver what to type.
Researched answer: The driver is the one with their hands on the keyboard and they are responsible for entering information and following the instructions provided by the navigator. There needs to be constant communication. Roles should be switched every 10-20 minutes and there should be breaks too.
## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week
Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.
1. Higher Order Functions: Essentially a function that accepts functions as parameters to either combine with other functions or stand alone.
2. Jest: Ensures correctness.
